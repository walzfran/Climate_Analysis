# Climate_Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
#### The purpose of this challenge was to learn about the weather in Oahu to show a potential investor for the business idea of a surf and ice cream shop. One of the main concerns that our potential investor, W. Avy, has is the precipitation on the island. When thinking about a shop such as the one we are looking to open, the weather is a large driving force in business levels and looking into both the temperature and precipitation is important. To analyze Hawaii's weather data we used SQAlchemy and created queries for the SQLite database. 

### Results
#### Deliverable One 
##### In the first deliverable we were tasked with writing a query that showed the temperatures for the month of June in Oahu, Hawaii. 
#### Deliverable Two
##### In the second deliverable we were tasked with writing a query that showed the temperatures for the month of December in Oahu, Hawaii.

#### Comparison
##### * Both of the temperature sets seemed to be similar, which is great news in this case because we want to make sure that business will be lucrative in both the summer and winter months. Below are both the temperature sets that were run with the queries that were made. The first is June and the second image is December.

![December Temperatures](https://github.com/walzfran/Climate_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Dec_Temp_Describe.png)

##### * Looking at these images, you can see that June was a bit warmer, about 4 degrees warmer overall, but the climate seems to be consistant for both months. 
##### * One concern that I see is that the minimum temperature is quite a bit lower in December than it is in June, but this is to be expected as it is a winter month. Although 56 degrees does not seem to be too cool, it would not be the ideal weather for ice cream or surfing... 
##### * With it being clear that it is warmer in June, one thing to consider would be a seasonal business plan, but I will address that more in the summary. 

### Summary
##### As I mentioned in the overview, one concern that W. Avy has is the precipitation levels on the island. In the deliverables we only analyzed the temperatures and we never looked at the precipitation levels, so I made two additional queries that looked at the precipitation levels for Oahu in both June and December. Below are the both sets, the first is June and the second is December.
