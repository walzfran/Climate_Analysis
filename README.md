# Climate_Analysis

### Overview of Analysis
#### The purpose of this challenge was to learn about the weather in Oahu to show a potential investor for the business idea of a surf and ice cream shop. One of the main concerns that our potential investor, W. Avy, has is the precipitation on the island. When thinking about a shop such as the one we are looking to open, the weather is a large driving force in business levels and looking into both the temperature and precipitation is important. To analyze Hawaii's weather data we used SQAlchemy and created queries for the SQLite database. 

### Results
#### Deliverable One 
##### In the first deliverable we were tasked with writing a query that showed the temperatures for the month of June in Oahu, Hawaii. 
#### Deliverable Two
##### In the second deliverable we were tasked with writing a query that showed the temperatures for the month of December in Oahu, Hawaii.

#### Comparison
##### * Both of the temperature sets seemed to be similar, which is great news in this case because we want to make sure that business will be lucrative in both the summer and winter months. Below are both the temperature sets that were run with the queries that were made. The first is June and the second image is December.

##### * Looking at these images, you can see that June was a bit warmer, about 4 degrees warmer overall, but the climate seems to be consistant for both months. 
##### * One concern that I see is that the minimum temperature is quite a bit lower in December than it is in June, but this is to be expected as it is a winter month. Although 56 degrees does not seem to be too cool, it would not be the ideal weather for ice cream or surfing... 
##### * With it being clear that it is warmer in June, one thing to consider would be a seasonal business plan, but I will address that more in the summary. 

### Summary
##### As I mentioned in the overview, one concern that W. Avy has is the precipitation levels on the island. In the deliverables we only analyzed the temperatures and we never looked at the precipitation levels, so I made two additional queries that looked at the precipitation levels for Oahu in both June and December. Below are the both sets, the first is June and the second is December.

![December Precipitation](https://github.com/walzfran/Climate_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Dec_Prcp_Describe.png)

##### Looking at these, you can see that there are fewer days in December that have precipitation but there is a higer amount of precipitation for the max. I thought that when looking at precipitation it might be more helpful to see it on a graph, that way there is a visual element to it. Below are both graphs that I generated with the new queries, the first is June and the second is December.

![December Graph](https://github.com/walzfran/Climate_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Dec_Prcp_Plot.png)

##### What I gather from these graphs is that although there is less rain in December, it seems to be harder more impactful rain which leads me to think that they are going to have stormier days which would detract from business levels. The rainfall in June is more frequent but smaller amounts which seems like it would be more like small periodic showers rather than storms. If it were me, I would go over a few other key months, like January, May and August so you can see a larger spread of the data and group them seasonally. I would do that to gauge whether it would benefit the business to lesser hours during the fall and winter months or to close all together in the cooler more rain heavy months. Overall, I don't think that there is a huge difference in either the temperature or the precipitation and Hawaii seems to be pretty temperate all year round, so a business like this would thrive in my opinion. But, it would be who of us to look at a few other months to break it down a bit more to W. Avy if he had any other concerns about the weather impacting business levels.
